## 📖 About Samadhan

Civic issues — broken roads, overflowing garbage, damaged streetlights, water leaks — are reported every day, but most complaint systems remain slow, opaque, and disconnected from the people they serve. Existing civic-tech tools usually solve only one piece of the problem in isolation: reporting, *or* mapping, *or* document storage.

**Samadhan** brings all of it together. Citizens can report an issue, have it verified by their community, track it on a live map, manage their government documents, check their eligibility for schemes, and earn recognition for civic participation — all inside one connected platform.

**Who it's for:**

| Primary Users | Secondary Users |
|---|---|
| Citizens | Community Volunteers |
| Municipal Authorities | NGOs |
| Government Departments | Smart City Administrators |

**How AI improves the experience:** every report is validated by Vision AI before it reaches a department, duplicate complaints are automatically detected and merged, and authorities receive AI-summarized civic intelligence instead of raw, unstructured complaint data — turning a manual workflow into an automated, trustworthy one.

<br/>

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 AI Issue Reporting
**Purpose:** Let citizens report civic issues in seconds using a photo or short video.
**Highlights:** AI-assisted issue categorization · geo-location tagging · complaint lifecycle tracking
**Benefits:** Faster reporting with minimal manual effort

### 🎥 Video Upload with Local Frame Extraction
**Purpose:** Support richer evidence without compromising privacy or storage cost.
**Highlights:** A representative frame is extracted **locally in-browser**; the original video is discarded immediately and never uploaded or stored — only the extracted frame enters the AI pipeline.
**Benefits:** Privacy-first reporting with zero video storage overhead

### 🔍 AI Issue Classification
**Purpose:** Automatically understand what an issue is and where it should go.
**Highlights:** Vision-based categorization · department recommendation
**Benefits:** Removes manual triage for both citizens and authorities

### 🧬 Duplicate Detection
**Purpose:** Prevent the same issue from being reported repeatedly.
**Highlights:** AI-powered duplicate complaint detection across existing reports
**Benefits:** Less administrative noise, cleaner data for authorities

### 🤝 Community Verification
**Purpose:** Make every complaint trustworthy through peer validation.
**Highlights:** Support/disagree voting (one vote per user) · community confidence score · "Community Verified" badge · interactive issue timeline · real-time updates
**Benefits:** Filters out false reports and builds public trust before authorities act
